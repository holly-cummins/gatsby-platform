# Holly's skeleton blog

This blog is a [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) blog, based on the [HeroBlog starter](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-hero-blog?tab=readme-ov-file). This code is still a starter, intended to be populated with content.
You can see the skeleton code running at [gatsby-platform.hollycummins.com](http://gatsby-platform.hollycummins.com).

## Initial setup

This codebase should run with Node v14, and a back-level gatsby cli.

```
nvm use 14
npm install -g gatsby-cli@2
npm install
./scripts/preprocess-publications.js
```

## Development

For local development

```text
gatsby develop
```

to hot-serve your website on http://localhost:8000 or

```text
gatsby build
```

to create static site ready to host (/public).

To run unit tests, use

```text
npm run test
```

Integration tests need the site to have been built first (and note that `develop` will un-build it)

```text
gatsby build
npm run test:int
```

### Adding content

The sample content lives in `./content`. This content location is awkward for using this repo as
an upstream framework, so user content would normally live in `../content`, outside this hierarchy.
As soon as a `../content` has been created it will be used as the source of content.

Blog posts live in `content/posts`.
To add an external publication, use `./scripts/add-pub.js [url]` and then fix up the generated content in `content/publications`. You will almost certainly have to update the date in the directory name. Once you've created the markdown, run `./scripts/preprocess-publications.js` to download cover images for local development. To add an external talk, use `./scripts/add-talk.js [slides] [video]` and then fix up the generated content in `content/posts`. Some content will be filled in from the oembed data by a plugin.

If downloading a fresh copy of the source, run `./scripts/preprocess-publications.js` to download gitignored cover images for local development.

To move something from draft to published, add a `yyyy-mm-dd` date prefix to the directory name.

To change the favicon, after replacing the files in `src/images/app-icons` you need to run npm run `generate-app-icons` and then copy the `static/icons/favicon-16x16.png` to `static/favicon.ico`.

You will also need to update `static/CNAME` with a good value for your repo.

### What are all the things?

- xxTemplate: used in generation to make components
- Page: A page with content (headline and body text)
- Article: Wrapped around pages, posts, and categories. Mysterious.
- Blog: The component on the front page with the unordered list and all the Items.
- Item: An entry on the front page.
- Post: A blog entry hosted on this site.
- Publication: A blog entry hosted elsewhere. Include a sentence or two in the markdown for the excerpt.
- Slug: The unique part of a page URL. The important feature is that it contains the title of the article, which helps with SEO.

### Git incantations

To use this as part of a different project (so that updates can be pulled in with low merge-angst), make a new git project which contains a
`content` folder. At the project root, run

```
git remote add platform git@github.com:holly-cummins/gatsby-platform.git
git subtree add --prefix platform platform main
```

To update with new platform changes, run
```
git fetch platform
git subtree pull --prefix platform platform main
git push
```

A merge commit will be generated.

The `.github/workdlows/build_and_publish.yml` will need to be manually copied to the new project root, and
a working directory added.

```
defaults:
  run:
    working-directory: platform
```

### Debugging and trouble shooting

http://localhost:8000/___graphql is useful for inspecting graphql results.

#### Missing cover children

If you get `Multiple unhandled runtime errors found in your files. See the list below to fix them:`, run ./scripts/preprocess-publications.js`

![Multiple unhandled runtime errors found in your files. See the list below to fix them](docs/missing-cover-children.png)

The same issue can also cause `WebpackError: TypeError: Cannot read property 'children' of null` on `gatsby build`.

##### External services

The starter uses external services for some functions: comments, searching, analytics. To use them you have to secure some access data. All services are free to use or have generous free tiers big enough for a personal blog.

Create an `.env` file like below in the root folder. Change `...` placeholders with real data.
<br />By default, your `.env` file will be ignored by git. Remove `.env` from `.gitignore` in order to be able to push the file to your repository.

```text
CLICKY_ID=...
ALGOLIA_APP_ID=...
ALGOLIA_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY=...
ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY=...
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=...
```
