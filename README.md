# Holly's blog

This blog is a [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) blog, based on the [HeroBlog starter](<(https://gatsby-starter-hero-blog.greglobinski.com/)>). <br /><br />

## Initial setup

This codebase [needs to run](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-hero-blog/issues/67) with Node v10, and a back-level gatsby cli. Other versions of node can cause a hang on `Building development bundle`.

```
nvm use 10
npm install -g gatsby-cli@2
npm install
```

## Development

For local development

```text
gatsby develop
```

to hot-serve your website on http://localhost:8000 or

```text
gatsby build
```

to create static site ready to host (/public).

To run unit tests, use

```text
npm run test
```

Integration tests need the site to have been built first (and note that `develop` will un-build it)

```text
gatsby build
npm run test:int
```

### Adding content

Blog posts live in `content/posts`.
To add an external publication, use `./scripts/add-pub.js [url]` and then fix up the generated content in `content/publications`. You will almost certainly have to update the date in the directory name. Once you've created the markdown, run `./scripts/preprocess-publications.js` to download cover images for local development.

To move something from draft to published, add a date prefix to the directory name.

To change the favicon, after replacing the files in `src/images/app-icons` you need to run npm run `generate-app-icons` and then copy the `static/icons/favicon-16x16.png` to `static/favicon.ico`.

### What are all the things?

- xxTemplate: used in generation to make components
- Page: A page with content (headline and body text)
- Article: Wrapped around pages, posts, and categories. Mysterious.
- Blog: The component on the front page with the unordered list and all the Items.
- Item: An entry on the front page.
- Post: A blog entry hosted on this site.
- Publication: A blog entry hosted elsewhere. Include a sentence or two in the markdown for the excerpt.
- Slug: The unique part of a page URL. The important feature is that it contains the title of the article, which helps with SEO.

### Debugging

http://localhost:8000/___graphql is useful for inspecting graphql results.

##### External services

The starter uses external services for some functions: comments, searching, analytics. To use them you have to secure some access data. All services are free to use or have generous free tiers big enough for a personal blog.

Create an `.env` file like below in the root folder. Change `...` placeholders with real data.
<br />By default, your `.env` file will be ignored by git. Remove `.env` from `.gitignore` in order to be able to push the file to your repository.

```text
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=...
ALGOLIA_APP_ID=...
ALGOLIA_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY=...
ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY=...
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=...
```
