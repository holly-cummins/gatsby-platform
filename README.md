# Holly's blog

This blog is a [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) blog, based on the [HeroBlog starter](<(https://gatsby-starter-hero-blog.greglobinski.com/)>). <br /><br />

## Development

For local development

```text
gatsby develop
```

to hot-serve your website on http://localhost:8000 or

```text
gatsby build
```

to create static site ready to host (/public).

To run unit tests, use

```text
npm run test
```

Integration tests need the site to have been built first (and note that `develop` will un-build it)

```text
gatsby build
npm run test:int
```

### What are all the things?

- xxTemplate: used in generation to make components
- Page: A page with content (headline and body text)
- Article: Wrapped around pages, posts, and categories. Mysterious.
- Blog: The component on the front page with the unordered list and all the Items.
- Item: An entry on the front page.
- Post: A blog entry hosted on this site.
- Publication: A blog entry hosted elsewhere.
- Slug: The unique part of a page URL.

##### External services

The starter uses external services for some functions: comments, searching, analytics. To use them you have to secure some access data. All services are free to use or have generous free tiers big enough for a personal blog.

Create an `.env` file like below in the root folder. Change `...` placeholders with real data.
<br />By default, your `.env` file will be ignored by git. Remove `.env` from `.gitignore` in order to be able to push the file to your repository.

```text
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=...
ALGOLIA_APP_ID=...
ALGOLIA_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY=...
ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY=...
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=...
FB_APP_ID=...
```
